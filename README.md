Data analysis and machine learning projects to solve common business problems

## Project 1: Churn Analysis
See 01_Telco-Churn.R for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the tuned random forest model to predict which customers are likely to churn, along with an analysis of which customer characteristics were most important in making the prediction and model evaluation and validation.

The final line of the file will produce an interactive Shiny Dashboard that allows you to filter customers by Contract Type, Internet Service, and Senior status. It also allows you to predict whether a customer will churn and assess the risk based on simple metrics, such as tenure and monthly charges.

## Project 2: Sales Funnel Analytics
