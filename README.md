# BusinessAnalytics
Data analysis and machine learning projects to solve common business problems

## Project 1: Churn Analysis
See 01_Telco-Churn.R for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the tuned random forest model to predict which customers are likely to churn, along with an analysis of which customer characteristics were most important in making the prediction and model evaluation and validation.

The final line of the file will produce an interactive Shiny Dashboard that allows you to filter customers by Contract Type, Internet Service, and Senior status. It also allows you to predict whether a customer will churn and assess the risk based on simple metrics, such as tenure and monthly charges.

## Project 2: Sales Funnel Analytics
See the 02-Sales-Funnel for the R script to conduct the analysis, resulting images, and final report. 

### Project Description
Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform has a B2B component that allows other businesses to sell their products on the platform, and they want to optimize their sales funnel. They need to understand how leads move through different stages of the funnel, where drop-offs occur, and what they can do to improve their data collection, as well as their conversion rate. By analyzing the funnel, the agency aims to find friction points and improve the efficiency of converting leads into customers​. Improving funnel efficiency is crucial, as even small gains in conversion at each stage can significantly boost overall sales. 

## Project 3: Cash Flow Analysis

### Project Description:
TBD

## Project 4: B2B Sales Performance Analysis, Conversion Optimiziation, and Revenue Forecasting

### Project Description: 
This project delivers a robust analytics and modeling framework to support sales intelligence and forecasting for a B2B medium-size American company. It begins with correlating geographic data to key sales metrics—including number of deals closed, average deal size, conversion rates, and average time to close—across global regions. At the contact level, the analysis tracks engagement and conversion by role (e.g., CEO, owner, sales leader), uncovering patterns in decision-making influence and acceleration of deal closure, based on detailed stage-date tracking. Deeper funnel analysis identifies factors that drive faster progression, such as completing key steps (e.g., interrogations) within specific time windows. The project also includes prospect and deal scoring models that incorporate behavioral signals like website activity and form submissions. Finally, it supports predictive forecasting with an emphasis on near-term (1–3 month) sales and revenue predictions, even for long-cycle B2B businesses. Forecast models will factor in churn risk, and regional dynamics.

Since this project is for a client, only the code will be shared.
