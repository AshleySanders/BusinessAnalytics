Data analysis and machine learning projects to solve common business problems

## Project 1: Churn Analysis
See 01_Telco-Churn.R for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the tuned random forest model to predict which customers are likely to churn, along with an analysis of which customer characteristics were most important in making the prediction and model evaluation and validation.

The final line of the file will produce an interactive Shiny Dashboard that allows you to filter customers by Contract Type, Internet Service, and Senior status. It also allows you to predict whether a customer will churn and assess the risk based on simple metrics, such as tenure and monthly charges.

## Project 2: Sales Funnel Analytics
See the 02-Sales-Funnel for the R script to conduct the analysis, resulting images, and final report. 

### Project Description
Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform has a B2B component that allows other businesses to sell their products on the platform, and they want to optimize their sales funnel. They need to understand how leads move through different stages of the funnel, where drop-offs occur, and what they can do to improve their data collection, as well as their conversion rate. By analyzing the funnel, the agency aims to find friction points and improve the efficiency of converting leads into customersâ€‹. Improving funnel efficiency is crucial, as even small gains in conversion at each stage can significantly boost overall sales.
